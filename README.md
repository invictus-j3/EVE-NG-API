# EVE-NG API Class

The idea of this respository came from getting tired having to start the same lab everytime the EVE-NG server shutdown or reboot. The __startup_lab.py__ script needs to be set to run at boot.

## Variables

All environment variables are stored in the __environment.json__ file.

Rename __environment-default.json__ to __environment.json__.
